# THOR-ESVC 
Telemetry system for a solar-powered electric car, tailored for the EVSC Competition. The system utilizes an STM32 microprocessor for transceiver functionality, enabling robust and reliable communication over long distances through the integration of LoRa technology. This setup ensures real-time data transmission even in challenging environments.

Implimenting a seamless data acquisition framework by incorporating PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. This framework enables precise and real-time monitoring, logging, and analysis of critical vehicle parameters, facilitating efficient vehicle operation and informed strategic decision-making during competition scenarios.
